INGREDIENTS
1/4 cup sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon
4 Tbsp butter, melted
2 flour tortillas

METHOD
1 Cut each flour tortilla into 6 to 8 wedges or use a cookie cutter to cut out shapes in the tortillas.

2 Preheat oven to 350°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or foil. Mix then sugar and cinnamon together in a small bowl and spread out over the bottom of a 	small plate. Melt butter in a small bowl.

3 Dip the cut pieces of flour tortilla in the melted butter, gently shake off the excess and place on the plate of cinnamon sugar. Only coat one side of the crisp in cinnamon sugar. Then place coated tortilla pieces, cinnamon sugar side up, on the lined baking tray.

4 Bake for 12 minutes at 350°F, or until the tortilla crisps are indeed "crisp". Remove from oven and let cool for 2 minutes.
